Hallicrafter Controller
=======================

Pure CircuitPython interface controller for Hallicrafter Smart Radio project.  Refactored for use on stand-alone microcontroller because the Neopixel control line and i2c bus create electronic interference on the Raspberry Pi audio DAC.

This code requires an M4 or better chip (ie, Feather M4, Metro M4) to use the OLED.
