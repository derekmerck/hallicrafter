Hallicrafter Controller
=======================

Derek Merck
Summer 2019


Heavy code ported from Raspberry Pi.  Requires an M4 or better chip (ie, Feather M4, Metro M4) to use the OLED.


Moved away from Raspberry Pi b/c the Neopixel control line sets up a buzzing in the DAC and the i2c(?) bus creates a staccato beat.
